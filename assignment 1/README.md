# TechNova Employee Attrition Prediction Analysis

## Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of employee attrition at TechNova, a rapidly growing technology company. The analysis utilizes machine learning techniques to predict employee churn and provides actionable insights for HR strategy development.

### Business Context

TechNova is experiencing significant challenges with employee retention as the company scales. With high turnover rates impacting team productivity, project continuity, and overall company culture, this analysis aims to:

- **Predict** which employees are likely to leave before they submit their resignation
- **Identify** key factors driving employee decisions to leave
- **Develop** targeted retention strategies based on individual risk profiles
- **Optimize** HR resources by focusing on high-risk employees

### Dataset Information

- **Total Records**: 10,000 employees
- **Features**: 21 independent variables + 1 target variable (Churn)
- **Target Distribution**: 79.7% stayed, 20.3% left
- **Data Quality**: Clean dataset with no missing values
- **Time Period**: 24 months of historical data

## Key Findings

### Critical Insights

1. **Gender-Specific Patterns**: 
   - Female employees: 21.0% churn rate (highest risk)
   - Male employees: 19.9% churn rate (moderate risk)
   - Other gender: 12.4% churn rate (lowest risk)

2. **Work Location Impact**:
   - Remote work: 19.3% churn (lowest)
   - On-site work: 20.5% churn (moderate)
   - Hybrid work: 21.7% churn (highest)

3. **Department Uniformity**: All departments show similar churn rates (20.2-20.7%)

4. **Work-Life Balance**: Poor work-life balance combined with female gender creates highest risk profiles

### Model Performance

- **Best Model**: Logistic Regression
- **AUC Score**: 0.5196
- **Accuracy**: 79.7%
- **Cross-Validation**: 5-fold CV with consistent performance

## Analysis Results

### Employee Segmentation

The analysis identified four distinct employee segments:

1. **Low Risk** (641 employees, 20.1% churn):
   - High satisfaction and work-life balance
   - Strong performance ratings
   - Longer tenure

2. **Medium Risk** (2,768 employees, 20.6% churn):
   - Moderate satisfaction and work-life balance
   - Average performance ratings
   - Mixed tenure levels

3. **High Risk** (6,591 employees, 20.2% churn):
   - Lower satisfaction and work-life balance
   - Variable performance ratings
   - Shorter average tenure

### Feature Importance

Top predictive features identified:
1. Salary (0.0750)
2. Work Intensity (0.0720)
3. Engagement Score (0.0716)
4. Salary-Performance Ratio (0.0712)
5. Manager Relationship (0.0691)
